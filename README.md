# **Personal Wallet**

This is a simple console application for tracking your own money.

You can create or log in to your account. You can also add monthly cash income, expenses cash by day and indicate deferred savings for a specific purpose.

You will also be able to track your budget (by filters: daily, weekly, monthly, and only for certain tags).

In the future, the possibility of exporting accounting data to Excel and graphics is considered
